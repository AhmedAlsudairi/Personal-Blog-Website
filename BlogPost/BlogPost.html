                <p id="introduction">Tokyo’s reputation for the weird and zany is widely known. So there’s no better
                    place than here to
                    get off the beaten path and try something new. Get out there and check out some of the most
                    unusual
                    experiences Tokyo has to offer.</p>

                    <h3>Dance with kawaii monsters</h3>
                    <p>At the <a href="#">Kawaii Monster Cafe</a> near Takeshita Street, you’ll meet the
                        <strong>kawaii</strong> monsters who personify the spirit of Harajuku and the subcultures
                        that
                        once flourished there. Take your seat in one of four uniquely themed rooms and dine on any
                        number of crazy rainbow concoctions, from pasta and cake to an alchemist’s drink. At the
                        heart
                        of the restaurant is an enormous carousel where the stage show takes place, and one lucky
                        audience member is invited to join in each time.</p>

                    <h3>Sip lattes with owls</h3>
                    <p>Tokyo is famous for its <a href="#">animal cafés</a> , where people can enjoy the benefits of
                        spending time with pets without all the commitment. It seems there’s something for everyone,
                        from cool reptiles and quiet bunnies to the more familiar house pets. But dogs and cats are
                        so
                        mainstream, so why not grab a drink with an enormous bird of prey instead at one of Tokyo’s
                        owl
                        cafes?</p>

                    <h3>Stay in a capsule hotel</h3>
                    <p><a href="#">Capsule hotels</a> have been around for decades, but their bare bones approach to
                        accommodation still intrigues visitors from all over the globe. Whether you’re looking for a
                        classic
                        capsule experience or something more luxurious, Tokyo has one of these minimalist hotels
                        with
                        your
                        name on it.</p>

                    <h3>Visit a maid café</h3>
                    <p><a href="#">Maid cafés</a> are a dime a dozen in <strong>Akihabara</strong> , Tokyo’s manga
                        and
                        anime culture center. Walk along the main drag and let the touts dressed in uniform show you
                        the
                        way, or just stroll along until you find one that catches your eye. Maid cafés are a fun,
                        safe
                        and totally PG, if weird, experience for all ages and genders.</p>

                    <h3>Catch dinner and a robot show</h3>
                    <p>Shinjuku’s <a href="#">Robot Restaurant</a> is everything you would expect from a night out
                        in
                        Tokyo.
                        The idea is dinner and a show, but with a twist: some of the performers just happen to be
                        robots.
                        The restaurant is true to its theme everywhere except the menu, from the metallic and
                        brightly
                        colored décor to the adorable robot souvenirs you can pick up on the way out.</p>

                    <h3>Pachinko ’til dawn</h3>
                    <p> <a href="#">Pachinko</a> is a wildly popular game in Japan, so it isn’t difficult to find a
                        pachinko
                        parlor at which to try your luck. These quirky gambling dens are immediately recognizable
                        from
                        the
                        loud noise and music spilling out into the street. The game is set up like a slot machine.
                        Players
                        sling small steel balls into the playing field and hope they’ll fall into the right cup for
                        a
                        payout. But if you’re wary of gambling the night away, you can try out no-risk pachinko at
                        ordinary
                        gaming arcades.</p>

                    <p>Tokyo is attractive city to visit it have a lot of things you can do, and have a lot of
                        places to
                        enjoy with delicious food.
                    <blockquote> “Tokyo would probably be the foreign city if I had to eat one city’s food for the
                        rest
                        of my life, every day. It would have to be Tokyo, and I think the majority of chefs you ask
                        that
                        question would answer the same way.” ―Anthony Bourdain</blockquote>
